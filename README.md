- Manage Redis caching infrastructure and Celery task queues

### Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
**Responsibilities:**
- Develop comprehensive test strategies and test plans
- Create and execute automated test suites for API endpoints
- Perform manual testing for user experience and edge cases
- Conduct performance testing to ensure system reliability under load
- Validate data integrity and security requirements
- Collaborate with developers to identify and resolve bugs
- Ensure compliance with functional and non-functional requirements
- Maintain test documentation and reporting

### Additional Team Considerations
- **Project Manager:** Coordinates team activities, manages timelines, and ensures project deliverables meet requirements
- **Frontend Developer:** Works closely with backend team to integrate APIs and create user interfaces
- **UI/UX Designer:** Designs user-friendly interfaces and optimizes user experience flows

## Technology Stack

The AirBnB Clone project leverages a modern and robust technology stack to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability. Below are the key technologies and their specific purposes in the project:

### Backend Framework
- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Used as the core framework for building the backend API and handling business logic.
- **Django REST Framework:** A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. Provides comprehensive tools for creating RESTful APIs with features like serialization, authentication, and viewsets.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system known for its reliability and advanced features. Used for storing all application data including users, properties, bookings, and reviews with strong data integrity and ACID compliance.

### API Technologies
- **GraphQL:** A flexible query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Provides an efficient alternative to REST for complex data fetching requirements.
- **OpenAPI Standard:** Used for documenting REST APIs to ensure clarity, consistency, and ease of integration for frontend developers and third-party consumers.

### Caching and Task Management
- **Redis:** An in-memory data structure store used for caching frequently accessed data and session management to improve application performance and reduce database load.
- **Celery:** A distributed task queue system for handling asynchronous operations such as sending email notifications, processing payments, and generating reports without blocking the main application thread.

### Containerization and Deployment
- **Docker:** A containerization platform that ensures consistent development and deployment environments across different systems, simplifying application deployment and scaling.

### Development and Operations
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated continuous integration and deployment pipelines for testing code changes, ensuring code quality, and deploying applications reliably to production environments.
